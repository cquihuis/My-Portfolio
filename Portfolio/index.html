            <h2>Hi there!</h2>
            <p>I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript! I'm in a coding bootcamp called G{Code}, 
            a program meant to help women and non-binary people of color to break into the tech field. This isn't my 
            first experience with coding, but I'm enjoying it more with the guidance and support of professionals and 
            peers. Below are facts about me as a person, the kind of things I've been working on, and how to contact me.</p>

            <h3>Some Things About Me</h2>
            <p> <br> I currently work as a jewelry consultant in South Texas, and I spend a lot of time learning about gemstones and 
            diamonds. In general, I've always loved to learn, and a lot of what I've learned becomes a medium for self-expression
            in some way. My strongest form of self-expression is simply writing. For this reason, I'm pretty good at it! 
            
            <br><br>
            In terms of hobbies, I love learning about cooking and baking! Videos, cookbooks, articles, word-of-mouth,
            I use all of those things to be able to learn more recipes. The process of preparing ingredients and mixing them
            all in certain proportions and in certain ways is meditative for me. I also love having my family and friends
            eat and enjoy the finished product. Both cooking and baking can be a lot of trial and error (like coding!), and it
            gets frustrating sometimes, but that's just what comes with learning.

                <h3>My Current Works</h3>
                <p> The works that I currently have are projects from G{Code}, but more personal and
                experimental projects coming soon! My style in my projects tends to be pretty colorful ;
                I love figuring out how and where I can add splashes of color and designs. Organization 
                is also really important to me, I like to make sure that whatever I'm making is easy to 
                follow.
